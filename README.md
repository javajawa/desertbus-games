I want to send in nice looking quiz challenges to Desert Bus.

Time to make my own toolchain.

Desert Bus 'themed' Only Connect fopr Alpha Flight

Hi, I'm Kitteh, and here is my Only Connect which is mojority DB themed.
Being a bit of a stickler for the rules, and a developer, I've built a web app to play on during my downtime this week...and started building Jackbox from first principles.

Hopefully next year I shall return with a more polished system. Thank you so much for bus, and I hope you enjoy the game.

Stage Friend / Tech notes: the game is at https://db.tea-cats.co.uk/, labelled 'OnlyConnect for AlphaFlight'.
The audit button will show you all the questions and answers in the game, and the play with one team will create a new instance of the game, and take you to the 'secret' DM url.
You can either crop the marked area at the bottom, or open the public page on another tab / machine to show the enterainers and stream!

I request and highly encourage feedback on the concept to bus@tea-cats.co.uk.
