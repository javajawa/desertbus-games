I want to send in nice looking quiz challenges to Desert Bus.

Time to make my own toolchain.

Night Watch 'themed' Only Connect for Night Watch

Hi, I'm [name], writing on behalf of Kitteh (who's asleep).
This is an automated Only Connect themed (mostly) around Desert Bus and this year's Night Watch (y'all have memory of that right?).
It consists of 2 rounds of 6 questions each, in a semi-automated website that allows a GM (engineeeing, stage friend of co-pilot) to decide if guesses are close enough.

Alpha Flight scored 15 on their board -- there are 3 questions that overlap.

---

Stage Friend / Tech notes: the game is at https://db.tea-cats.co.uk/, labelled 'OnlyConnect for Night Watch'.
The audit button will show you all the questions and answers in the game, and the play with one team will create a new instance of the game, and take you to the 'secret' DM url.
You can either crop the marked area at the bottom, or open the public page on another tab / machine to show the entertainers and stream! (which you can also crop to the red box if you want more screen space)

I request and highly encourage feedback on the concept to bus@tea-cats.co.uk.
