                <p>
                    CatBox Games is a custom game platform in the vein of
                    <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/" target="_blank">JackBox Games</a>,
                    aimed for use on <a href="https://desertbus.org/" target="_blank"> Desert Bus for Hope</a>.

                        <p>
                            The system currently supports games of
                            <a href="#this-or-that">This or That</a> and
                            <a href="#only-connect">Only Connect</a>.
                            Jump in to any game "episode", featuring community curated questions.
                            Games can be played with optional score tracking,
                            differing numbers of teams, and optional audience support.

                            Each game can be played either with players using their own devices,
                            or run fully by a Game Manager inputting choices.
                            Each type of control/view gets its own four-letter room code,
                            ensuring that streamers and chat don't accidentally end up in the wrong
                            places.
                            (Note: "Audience" members will need their own browser device).

                        <p>
                            The Game Manager also has the power to change the sequence of the game,
                            skipping between rounds in the game, or ending it immediately, in order
                            to keep the flow of the show moving.

                            Users can log in (with Twitch) and create their own episodes.
                            Editing an episode reuses the game play systems, giving it support
                            for collaborative editing between multiple users.

                            Episode information is versioned, with reviewed and published versions
                            being locked from editing.

                            Once a episode is submitted from the CMS, it needs to be approved by a
                            moderator before being listed on the main site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, the game manager can preview the content of an episode to
                            check for any specific concerns before playing.

                <p>
                    "This or That" is a game with a very simple premise: given two categories,
                    can the players sort the various clues into them. Starting from the original
                    "Magic Card or Metal Band", This or That has a...long tradition? Sure.

                    <li>Support for one to four teams, or disabling scoring.</li>
                    <li>Support for audience members to act as an extra team.</li>
                    <li>Questions consist of a clue and answer information, both of which can be text, and image, or both.</li>
                    <li>The game system automatically displays possible options, from "this", "that", "both", or "neither", based on all the answers in the episode.</li>
                    <li>Vote interfaces are available for each team, and the audience, along with a streamable view of the current question, and a DB-compatible score overlay.</li>

                    Only Connect is a British game show known for being
                    "deliciously devious and maddeningly abstract", in which
                    connections must be made between apparently unconnected
                    things.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Support for either one or two teams.</li>
                    <li>All four rounds (Connections, Sequences, Connecting Wall, and Missing Vowels) are supported but optional.</li>
                    <li>Note: the connecting wall will be skipped when playing with two teams if there is only one wall.</li>
                    <li>Questions are text-only (media support planned for DB2025).</li>
                    <li>Features a heads-up view for the players (which can be used as an input for the connecting wall), and a DB-compatible stream overlay.</li>
